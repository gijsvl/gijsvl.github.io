	My research in cryptography is focused around zero knwowledge proofs, multi-party computation, and authentication protocols. I'm pursuing a PhD at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. I'm part of the <a href="https://arc.isi.jhu.edu/">Advanced Research in Cryptography group</a> and my advisor is <a href="https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/">Dr. Matthew Green</a>.
