title: Yet Another Crypto/Infosec Blog
date:   2017-10-10 12:00:00
description: Welcome, dear reader. This is yet another blog about cryptography and information security. Is this really necessary, you’re asking yourself. Well, I think it is. Given the recent increase of cyberattacks and concern about information security in general, in combination with the shortage of good infosec people, and last but not least, the lack of security knowledge among many developers, every information source might be valuable. I hope this blog can help to shed light on some topics in information security and can help developers to write more secure code. Nevertheless, some posts might get very theoretical on cryptography, just because I can’t help it.

Welcome, dear reader. This is yet another blog about cryptography and information security. Is this really necessary, you’re asking yourself. Well, I think it is.

I hope this blog can help to shed light on some topics in information security and can help developers to write more secure code. Nevertheless, some posts might get very theoretical on cryptography, just because I can’t help it.

Enjoy reading!
